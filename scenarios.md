# Training Scenarios

If you're an **individual contributor**, use training to boost performance in your current role, prepare for a new role or responsibility, or move your career in a whole new direction.

If you're a **hiring manager**, consider outsourcing new hire onboarding tasks, reducing the burden on the rest of your team.

If you're a **student in a code camp or programming class**, personalized one-on-one support can help you get the most out of your program, whether it's a single session or on-going coaching.

Here are some examples of the types of training that can be useful for different roles. There are many other possibilities, and I'm happy to craft a training plan that works for your specific needs.
