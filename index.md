# A Better Way to Learn

It's hard to find technical training designed for people without a computer science background. Training often goes too fast. Instructors donâ€™t adjust to the background knowledge of the students. And courses cover too much material instead of concentrating on the important parts.

I believe there's a better approach. By focusing only on a topic's core concepts, and by going at a pace that matches each student's technical background, I give my clients the confidence to apply new skills the very next day. My instruction is always personalized and relevant to real tasks.
