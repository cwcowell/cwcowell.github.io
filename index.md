# A Better Way to Learn

It's hard to find technical training for non-technical people. Training often goes too fast. It doesnâ€™t adjust to the background knowledge of the students. And it tries to teach too much instead of concentrating on the important parts.

I believe there's a better approach. By focusing only on a topic's core concepts, and by going at a pace that matches each student's technical background, I give my clients the confidence to apply new skills the very next day. My training is pesonalized, confidence-inspiring, and highly relevant.
