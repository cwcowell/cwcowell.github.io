Ruby is an interpreted language, as opposed to a compiled language. This means that when you run a Ruby program, a separate program called a "Ruby interpreter" looks at your Ruby code and runs it directly. In contrast, compiled languages don't use interpreters but instead "compile" their code into another form and then run that transformed code. Because compiled languages use this extra compilation step, they're usually slower to get running than interpreted languages. But once they're up and running, they usually do their work faster (sometimes *much* faster) than interpreted languages. .  that is closer in some sense to the computer's hardwareCompiled languages, in If Ruby were a compiled language, you would use a "compiler" instead of transforming it into There are a few different "implementations" of Ruby available.
