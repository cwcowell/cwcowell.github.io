# Services

I teach technical subjects to less-technical audiences, especially non-programmer professionals at software companies. I help career changers, new hires, and anyone who needs to quickly swim, not drown, in deeper technical waters. 

I also enjoy teaching students who need a little extra support during their code camp or other classes, or who need to quickly catch up on prerequisites for upcoming classes.

I work with each client to identify the best form and content for their needs.
