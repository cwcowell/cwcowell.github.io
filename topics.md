# Training Topics

The amount of time spent on each topic depends on how in-depth you need the training to be. The most relevant parts of many topics can be covered in one to three hours. 

See [here](#approach.html) for more information on my philosophy of effective training and how that affects training time.

I'm always looking for ways to expand my training repertoire, so if you're interested in a technology, process, or language not listed here, please ask.
