# About

Cowell Technical Training is a one-man operation: I create the curricula and training materials, and I lead all instruction.


### Technical Background

My fascination with computers and programming started at age twelve, when I beta tested Infocom's Apple II text adventures.

After studying computer science in college, I worked for eighteen years as a developer and test automator at large and small software and consulting companies. Each of those roles included training and mentoring responsibilities, which were the best parts of my job.

These days, I keep my brain limber by studying and practicing machine learning, neural networks, and functional programming.

### Teaching Background

My love for teaching developed in middle school, when I taught BASIC programming to younger students and VisiCalc to their parents. 

In philosophy graduate school I got refined my teaching approach and presentation strategies by instructing hundreds of undergraduates in logic, writing, and philosophy.

Since then I've been an adult literacy tutor to General Motors assembly line workers, taught test automation to non-programming QA colleagues, and lectured high school students on how to break into the software industry.

While working as a developer I've done one-on-one coaching, presented to 150 people, and covered every size of group in between. I've given talks and classes on technical and non-technical topics.

Gently and patiently helping people understand new concepts and learn to do things they couldn't do yesterday is just about the most fun activity I can think of.
