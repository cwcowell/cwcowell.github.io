## Tagline

Patient and painless technical training for non-technical people.


## Elevator pitch

It’s hard to find good technical training for non-technical people. Training often goes too fast. It doesn’t adjust to the background knowledge of the students. And it tries to teach too much instead of concentrating on the important parts. Rose City Technical Training is different. Our mission is to introduce technical topics to non-technical audiences. Our approach is based on the Pareto Principle, which says that 80% of results come from 20% of effort. We concentrate on the first 20% of each subject we teach, since that’s often all our students will ever need to know. Result? Our training is approachable, confidence-inspiring, and highly relevant for students with little or no technical background.


## Services

In short, I train non-technical or less-technical audiences in technical topics. Since this sort of training can take different forms, the first step is to work with you to figure out things like:

+ Format
 + one-on-one
 + small group (up to 20 people)
+ Location
  + your workplace
  + via video conference
  + co-working space
+ Topics (see a full list [here](#topics)

### Sample use cases

+ A new technical writer with a strong journalism background but little experience with computers gets a headstart by learning Linux/macOS terminal commands, DITA, Oxygen, and Git.
+ A non-programmer in Quality Assurance moves into a higher-paying test automation role by learning the basics of Java, object-oriented programming concepts, and Selenium.
+ A hiring manager for a UI/UX team outsources the onboarding of a group of new hires by training them in Git, Jira, and the Agile/Scrum process.
+ A dev tech lead increases her visibility within the company by learning presentation skills.
+ A product owner reduces miscommunication and expensive rework by learning cutting-edge requirements gathering techniques with Cucumber, Gherkin, and Example Mapping.
+ A documentation team prepares for their company's new APIs by learning about REST, `curl`, Postman, and REST API documentation best practices.
+ A software sales manager reduces attrition and increases the effectiveness of his sales team by training them in presentation skills and the company's REST APIs.


## Approach

My specialty is training non-technical or less-technical audiences. For many topics, I'm able to go more in-depth for folks who already have a grasp of the basics.
 
I’ve found that experienced employees at software companies spend the majority of their time using only a small subset of the features of any technology, language, or process. We consider this a best practice, because it lets people get their work done without wasting time memorizing and practicing little-used, low-value features. Our training is built around this observation: we introduce students to just the first 20% of each technical topic. This approach lets them quickly start using what they’ve learned without getting bogged down in impossible-to-memorize technical details that will probably never be relevant to them.
We focus on non-technical students working for companies where some amount of technical knowledge is crucial to job success. This includes writers, UX designers, sales and marketing, product owners, project managers, and HR.
We believe in multi-modal learning. Each student will learn a little, do a little, and teach a little. This cements understanding far better than listening to a lecture ever could.
We understand that technical training can be scary for non-technical students. We specialize in humanizing technical content to reduce or eliminate any fear and let students feel confident and comfortable.
We find training to be most successful in groups of six students or less. Personalized 1:1 training is almost always the most effective approach.
We focus on the 20% of each technology or process that the students will use most in their jobs. 


## Training topics

These are the topics I've taught in the past. I'm happy to expand my repertoire, so if you're interested in training on a subject not listed here, please ask!

The amount of time spent on each topic depends on how in-depth you need the training to be. The most relevant parts of many topics can be covered in one to three hours.

## About Me

Technical training is the perfect blend of my two biggest interests: technology and teaching.

### Technical background

My fascination with computers and programming started at age twelve, when I beta tested Apple II text adventures for one of the leading game publishers of the era. 

After studying computer science in college, I worked for eighteen years as a developer and test automator at large and small software and consulting companies. Each of those roles included training and mentoring responsibilities, which were always the most rewarding and exciting parts of my job. 

These days, most of my own learning revolves around machine learning, neural networks, and functional programming.


### Teaching background

My love for teaching developed in middle school, when I taught Basic programming to younger students and VisiCalc to their parents. 

In philosophy graduate school I got the chance to refine my teaching approach and presentation strategies by instructing hundreds of undergraduates in logic, writing, and philosophy. 

Since then I've been an adult literacy tutor to General Motors assembly line workers, taught and test automation to non-programming QA colleagues, and lectured high school students on how to break into the software industry. 

While working as a developer I've done one-on-one coaching, lectured to 150 people, and covered every size of group in between. I've presented on technical and non-technical topics. 

Gently and patiently helping people understand new concepts and learn to do things they couldn't do yesterday is just about the most fun activity I can think of.
