# My Training Approach

**I specialize in training non-technical or less-technical people** working for companies that expect some technical knowledge. This includes writers, UI/UX, sales and marketing, product owners, project managers, HR, and many other non-technical departments of tech companies. 
 
I teach in a **humane, non-intimidating way using patience, humor, and empathy,** because I know that technical training can be scary or overwhelming for folks without technical backgrounds. I try hard to reduce fear or impostor syndrome in my students. If they ever feel their grasp of the material slipping, I change direction, pace, or teaching techniques until I find a way of explaining things that works for them.

I cover the **most relevant part of each technical topic,** in order not to swamp students in details they'll never use. This is based on the observation that experienced techies deliberately and successfully spend most of their time using only a small subset of any technology, language, or process. Carefully focused training lets students immediately use what they've learned without getting bogged down in hard-to-memorize, low-value technical details.

My students **learn a little, do a little, and teach a little**. After I explain a concept, students can build their understanding by practicing with hands-on exercises. Because teaching is the best way to learn, I often ask them to teach concepts back to me. Combining these three approaches cements understanding far better than simply listening to a lecture ever could. 

**One-on-one training** is almost always most the successful format. Groups of **six students or fewer** is almost as effective, though usually goes more slowly. Depending on your training goals, I can usually give **larger-group** training if the other formats aren't practical.
