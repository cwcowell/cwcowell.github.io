<p class=" testimonial">
My team was incredibly fortunate to work with Chris this past fall. We brought him on board to help develop a beginner-level self-paced course for one of our open-source products. Chris was thoughtful and communicative throughout the project, and maintained a clear empathy for the learner, ensuring the content would be approachable and engaging for people of all experience levels. We couldn’t be happier with the resulting course, and would be happy to work with Chris again!
